        The idea for this competition was born in drama of the flood. At the time, I was working on&nbsp;illustrating 
        flooded areas to send them out into the world as a testament to the changes that had impacted
        entire cities. However, being in the very heart of the affected regions, I realized that the&nbsp;emotional
        weight of the situation was more than I could handle. I came to understand that it wasn&apos;t fair
        to expect others &ndash; who had not experienced this personally &ndash; to illustrate the drama of&nbsp;the&nbsp;flood.
        Instead, I realized that a more fitting direction would be a project that takes into account places
        meaningful to each person, whether it&apos;s Cracow&apos;s Kazimierz, the colorful courtyards of Wrocław,
        the Odra river boulevards in Opole, or a hallway with a cat.
    </p>
    <p>
        A postcard &ndash; sometimes even kitschy &ndash; sent from a trip can tell more about a place than the most
        beautiful photograph. That&apos;s why today, I&apos;m sending my postcard to all the invited creators, hoping
        to receive postcards from them in return.
